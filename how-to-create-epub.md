Annotations from the book "What is EPUB 3" by Matt Garrish, published by O'REILLY.


EPUB and Ebook are not synonymous. EPUB is a format for representing documents in electronic form. Ebook is an abstract term used to encopass any electronic representation of a book, and includes formats such as PDF, HTML, ASCII text, Word, and a host of others, in addition to EPUB.

EPUB was always intended to be a general purpose document format, and in it can be use to represent many kinds of publications other than just books: from magazines to newspapers to journals and on through office documents and policies and beyond.
